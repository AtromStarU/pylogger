Stuff I Want To Add:
- KillSwitch (Destroy Itself)
- Status     (Create Logfile on Desktop)
- Dump_<DriveLetter>     (Copy all info to Drive Letter)
- Suspend    (Suspend the Capture)
- Resume     (Resume the Capture)

Rough Brainstorming of Ideas:
- Encryption so that if caught its hard to figure out what program is doing
- Zip Files
- At a certain time of day: send random UDP aimed nowhere with data so you can fish them out of the air through Wireshark.
